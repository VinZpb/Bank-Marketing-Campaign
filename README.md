# Bank-Marketing-Campaign
This GitHub repository contains code for predicting whether customers will subscribe to a bank's term deposit based on marketing campaign data. This can help the bank target potential customers more effectively.

**Overview**
The project uses machine learning on historical customer data to make predictions. Here's a simplified structure of the repository:

Data: The dataset is already in this repository named data_bank_marketing_campaign.csv.

Notebooks: The code is in Jupyter Notebook named Vincent_MachineLearning_BankMarketingCampaignClassification.ipynb in this repository.

Models: The final model used is saved in a file named Vincent_FinalModel_BeforeThreshold.sav in this repository.

The final model saved is the one that performs the best after hyperparameter tuning. However, it's important to note that the best results can only be achieved after optimizing its threshold, which is set to 0.483077. Therefore, before using the model for predictions, remember to set its threshold to 0.483077.
